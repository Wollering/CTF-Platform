**Core System Architecture**
The CTF platform combines the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with AWS serverless technologies to create a scalable, flexible environment for cybersecurity challenges. The system includes:

* Frontend Components - React-based interface with user authentication, challenge catalog, real-time scoring, and team collaboration features

* Backend Services - Express.js and Node.js running on AWS Lambda with API Gateway, handling challenge management, scoring validation, and user progress tracking

* Database Structure - MongoDB with document schemas for users, teams, challenges, submissions, and environments

* AWS Serverless Implementation - Full serverless architecture including:
	* 	API Gateway for REST endpoints
	* 	Lambda functions for backend logic
	* 	DynamoDB for persistence
	* 	CloudFormation for infrastructure as code
	* 	S3 for static assets
	* 	Cognito for authentication

* Challenge Environment Management
A critical aspect of the system is the isolated challenge environment provisioning:

* Environment Provisioner - Creates isolated AWS resources for each participant or team using CloudFormation templates
Challenge Validator - Verifies challenge completion through specialized Lambda functions for different challenge types (web security, cloud security, cryptography, etc.)
Resource Cleanup - Automatically terminates inactive environments to control costs

**Key Features**
The platform supports a wide range of cybersecurity challenge types:

* Web application security (SQL injection, XSS)
* Network security
* Cloud security specific to AWS
* Cryptography
* Forensics
* Reverse engineering

Each challenge includes:

Difficulty rating and point values
* Hint progression system
* Automated validation
* Progress tracking
* Real-time feedback

**Implementation Guide**
The artifacts created provide:

* System Architecture Overview - Detailed technical specifications of all system components
* Core Implementation Examples - Code samples for key backend and frontend components
* Challenge CloudFormation Template - Example template for creating an isolated challenge environment
* Lambda Challenge Validators - Implementation of various challenge validation functions
* Deployment Guide - Step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform

**Next Steps**
To fully implement this platform, you would:

* Start with the system architecture outline to develop the core infrastructure
* Implement the serverless backend components using the provided code examples
* Develop the React frontend with challenge management interface
* Create CloudFormation templates for different challenge types
* Implement validation functions for each challenge category
* Follow the deployment guide to set up the platform
